# Weakly nonlinear analysis of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells

This repository contains companion code for the paper 'Weakly nonlinear analysis of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells' by C. S. Skene and S. M. Tobias (in review).

## Available code
1. *critical_Rayleigh.py* finds the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection using optimisation techniques.
2. *wnl_coefficients.py* computes the coefficients of the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation.
3. *read_data.py* merges data files created by computing the weakly nonlinear coefficients at different paramters.
4. *convection.py* runs the full nonlinear equations starting from the unstable mode in order to validate the weakly nonlinear description.
